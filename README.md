# My interpretation of a LocalStorage Todo-app using Angular 1
The goal of this project is to try to understand the very basics of Angular.
http://angularjs.org

All the Todos are saved into LocalStorage by my own LocalStorageService.
It is only possible to add and remove Todos, no editing functionality at the moment.
The project was put together in about two hours.
